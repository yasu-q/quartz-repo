- [](https://umd.webex.com/umd/j.php?MTID=m9a1f6e173d852d497b3ab2b4485d41dc)Working in groups is highly recommended, but _you_ have to write solutions to homework problems in your own words or you won't learn.

**Recommended Textbooks:** While there are no required textbooks for this class students are highly encouraged to take advantage of the following resources:

- My YouTube Channel, where I will post occasional relevant videos:  [https://www.youtube.com/@DrEbrahimianMathCoursesLinks to an external site.](https://www.youtube.com/@DrEbrahimianMathCourses)

- [H . Edwards, Jr.,  Advanced Calculus of Several Variables,](https://store.doverpublications.com/0486683362.html) Dover, 480 pages, Edition 1995 ISBN 10: 0486683362 ISBN 13: 9780486683362.

- ==Susan Colley’s Vector Calculus (an electronic version is sufficient),==

- ==[Oliver Knill’s notes on Vector Calculus](http://people.math.harvard.edu/~knill/teach/index.html) (exams, exhibits, handouts are also very useful).== 

**Homework:** Homework will be regularly assigned. Feel free to work in groups but __you__ should write your submitted solutions or you would not learn. Most of the problems on exams and quizzes will be very similar to homework problems or examples done in class. Homework will be graded by a grader. We do our best to hire capable graders, but I cannot guarantee the accuracy of grading homework. If you aren't sure about something please ask. Homework will be collected electronically via Gradescope. You can access Gradescope via the panel on ELMS on the left.

**Grading and make-up policies:** Your grade for this course will be determined by:

- ==**Two semester exams 20% each:**== Your lowest semester exam will be replaced by your Final exam, if it helps your grade. (Of course, both scores will be normalized to 100% before being compared.)
- **==Weekly quizzes 20%:==** Your lowest two quiz scores will be dropped.
- **==Homework 15%:==** Your lowest two homework scores will be dropped.
- **==Cumulative final exam 25%==**

Quizzes and Exams are given at the beginning of the class, so make sure you are on time.

If you miss a quiz/exam you are required to notify me **before** the quiz/exam and bring documentation of the illness, signed by a health-care professional and ask for a make-up quiz/exam. Note that my goal is to write a make-up quiz/exam that is of similar level of difficulty, but the make-up quiz/exam may not be identical to the original quiz/exam. Requests of make-up quiz/exam must be made before the test or as soon as possible.

**Appeals**: My goal is to make sure all exams and quizzes are graded consistently and fairly. In case you notice an error, you should bring it to my attention at most a week after you receive your exam, quiz or assignment back. After the final exam, only the final exam may be appealed; other exams, quizzes or assignments may not be appealed after the final exam.

**Students in this class are expected to:**

- attend class regularly.
- be able to write short proofs.
- write solutions that are legible and complete. This applies to homework, quizzes and the tests.
- come to each class prepared, having understood all the previous material.

**Students with disability:** Students with a documented disability must make an appointment with the ADS office to discuss their accommodations. After that, you would need to meet with me **in the first week of the semester** and discuss your accommodations with me. Accommodations for exams must be arranged at least **a week** before the exam date. This is an ADS policy. **All students with approved accommodations must take their exams in the ADS office.**

**Attendance:** Regular attendance and participation in this class are the best ways to grasp the concepts and principles being discussed. If you miss a class, it is your responsibility to know what was covered and what announcements were made. Check with one of your classmates for that. Skip a class at your own risk. If you miss a class when homework is due, you are still required to submit your homework on time. The topics covered in class will not always match what is in the textbooks. **During the class please refrain from using electronic devices except for note taking.**

**Communicating with the class:** I will communicate with the class via ELMS Announcements. Make sure your email is updated on ELMS and you receive notifications for ELMS Announcements.

**Honor Code:** According to the University of Maryland Code of Academic Integrity,

__“All members of the University community-students, faculty, and staff-share the responsibility and authority to challenge and make known acts of apparent academic dishonesty.”__

If you are caught cheating, it is my job to report you to the Office of Student Conduct, which typically results in an XF on your transcript. For more information, visit the webpage of the OSC at [http://osc.umd.edu/](http://osc.umd.edu/).
