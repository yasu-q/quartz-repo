The Second Partials Test ([[9.1 Critical points in R2]]) for a function $f : \mathbb{R}^2 → \mathbb{R}$ allows us to determine if a critical point is a local minimum, a local maximum, or a saddle point. Now, we will turn our focus to n variable real-valued functions. Similar to what we did in the 2-dimensional case, we start with studying quadratic forms ([[9.1 Critical points in R2]])
## 10.1 Symmetric matrices
A matrix $A$ is called symmetric if $A^T = A$. In other words, the $(i, j)$ entry of $A$ is the same as its $(j, i)$ entry for all $i, j$

Diagonals are equal
## Theorem 10.1
Any quadratic form $q : \mathbb{R}^n → \mathbb{R}$ can be written as $q({\bf x}) = {\bf x}^T A{\bf x}$, where $A ∈ M_n(\mathbb{R})$ is symmetric and ${\bf x} ∈ \mathbb{R}^n$ is a column vector. Furthermore, given $q$, this symmetric matrix $A$ is unique. Note that in the theorem above if $q(x_1, . . . , x_n) = \sum\limits_{1≤i≤j≤n} a_{ij} x_ix_j$  then the $(i, j)$ entry of $A$ is $a_{ij} /2$ or $a_{ji}/2$ depending on whether $i < j$ or $j < i$, and the $(i, i)$ entry of A is $a_{ii}$

i.e. any quadratic form can be written in the form
$$
q({\bf x}) = {\bf x}^T A{\bf x}
$$

## Example 10.1
Find the matrix associated with the quadratic form
$$
g(x,y,z) = x^2 + 2y^2- z^2 + 3xy + xz - yz
$$
Refer to the diagram above. Remember that this matrix should be symmetric. This gives the following matrix
$$
A = 
\begin{pmatrix}
	1 & \frac{3}{2} & \frac{1}{2} \\
	\frac{3}{2} & 2 & -\frac{1}{2} \\
	\frac{1}{2} & -\frac{1}{2} & -1
\end{pmatrix}

## 10.2 Matrix of a quadratic form
Given a symmetric $n×n$ matrix $A$ the quadratic form $q({\bf x}) = {\bf x}^T A{\bf x}$ is called the quadratic form associated with $A$. We also say $A$ is the matrix associated with $q$

Note that ${\bf 0}$ is a critical point of $q$. Also, for a quadratic form $q$, a scalar $c$, and a vector ${\bf x}$ we have $q(c{\bf x}) = c^2q({\bf x}$). Therefore, to determine if ${\bf 0}$ is a local minimum, local maximum or a saddle point, we need to determine the maximum and minimum of $q$ over the unit sphere given by $||{\bf x}|| = 1$. This can be done using the Lagrange Multipliers Theorem.
## Theorem 10.2
 A quadratic form q has a local minimum (resp. local maximum) at ${\bf 0}$ if and only if $q$ is positive semidefinite (resp. negative semidefinite). Similarly, $q$ has a saddle point at ${\bf 0}$ if and only if ${\bf q}$ is nondefinite
## Theorem 10.3
Let $q$ be a quadratic form associated with an $n × n$ symmetric matrix $A$. If ${\bf q}$ attains its maximum or minimum value on the unit sphere in $\mathbb{R}^n$ at a point ${\bf v}$ (with $||{\bf v}|| = 1$), then $A{\bf v} = λ{\bf v}$ for some $λ ∈ R$

i.e. ${\bf q}$'s maximum and minimums will be eigenvalues vectors of its matrix, and they will of course occur at eigen vectors on the unit sphere
## 10.3 Eigenvectors
Given a square matrix $A$, we say a nonzero vector ${\bf v}$ is an eigenvector of $A$ if there is $λ ∈ \mathbb{R}$ for which $A{\bf v} = λ{\bf v}$. The number $λ$ is called an eigenvalue of $A$, and the pair $(λ, {\bf v})$ is called an eigenpair of $A$.

These are kind of a big deal in linear algebra

## Theorem 10.4
Given a quadratic form $q$ on $\mathbb{R}^n$, the maximum and minimum value of this quadratic form on the unit sphere $\{{\bf x} ∈ \mathbb{R}^n \,|\, ||{\bf x}|| = 1\}$ are the largest and smallest eigenvalues of the matrix $A$ associated with $q$.

## Theorem 10.5
A real number $λ$ is an eigenvalue of a square matrix $A$ if and only if $\det(A − λI) = 0$, where $I$ is the identity matrix

[[Note about eigenvectors]]
### Corollary 10.1
Let $A$ be the matrix associated with a quadratic form $q$. Then, the maximum and minimum values of $q({\bf x})$ where ${\bf x}$ is on the unit sphere is the largest and smallest real root $λ$ of the equation $det(A−λI) = 0$
***
## Example 10.3
Find the maximum and minimum values of the quadratic form
$$
q(x,y) = 3x^2 + 2y^2 - 2xy
$$
Subject to the condition 
$$
x^2+y^2 = 1
$$
First, find the matrix associated with the quadratic form. 
$$
A = 
\begin{pmatrix}
3 & -1 \\
-1 & 2
\end{pmatrix}
$$
Next, setup the equation
$$
\det(A - \lambda I) = 0
\,\,\,\, \Rightarrow \,\,\,\,
\det
\begin{pmatrix}
	3 - \lambda & -1 \\
	-1 & 2-\lambda
\end{pmatrix}
=0
$$
Take the determinant
$$
(3-\lambda)(2-\lambda) - (-1)^2 = 0
$$
$$
\Rightarrow \lambda^2 - 5\lambda + 5 = 0
$$
Which gets us the following values for lambda
$$
\lambda = \frac{5 \pm \sqrt{5}}{2}
$$
So the minimum is $-$ and the maximum is $+$
