We know from the definition of directional derivatives ([[8.1 Directional derivatives]]) that
$$
\lim\limits_{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{ F({\bf a} + h{\bf v}) - F({\bf a}) - h D_{{\bf v}}F({\bf a})}{h}
=
{\bf 0}
$$
This brings us to the following
## 8.2 Differentiability at a coordinate
 Let ${\bf a}$ be a point in an open subset $U$ of $\mathbb{R}^n$. We say $F : U → \mathbb{R}^m$ is differentiable at ${\bf a}$ if there exists a linear transformation $L : \mathbb{R}^n → \mathbb{R}^m$ such that
$$
 \lim\limits_{{\bf h} \rightarrow 0} \frac{F({\bf a + {\bf h}}) - F({\bf a}) - L({\bf h})}{||\, {\bf h} \,||} = {\bf 0}
$$

also
$$
 \lim\limits_{{\bf h} \rightarrow 0} \frac{F({\bf a + {\bf h}}) - F({\bf a}) - F'({\bf a}) h}{||\, {\bf h} \,||} = {\bf 0}
$$
[[4.2 Linear transformations and matrix operations]]. Yes $F'({\bf a})$ is a matrix (see Jacobian)
## Theorem 8.2
If a linear transformation $L$ in the previous definition exists, then it is unique
## 8.3 Differential of $F$ 
The linear transformation in the above theorem is called the differential of $F$ at ${\bf a}$, and is denoted by $dF_{\bf a}$ . Its matrix is called the derivative of $F$ at ${\bf a}$, and is denoted by $F'({\bf a}) = F'({\bf a}){\bf h}$, where ${\bf h}$ is a column vector in $\mathbb{R}^n$ 

Suppose $U$ is an open subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$. Let $F : U → \mathbb{R}^m$ be a function that is differentiable at some $a ∈ U$ . Then $dFa : \mathbb{R}^n → \mathbb{R}^m$ is linear and its matrix $F ′({\bf a})$ is an $m × n$ matrix for which $dF_a({\bf h}) = F'({\bf a})h$, where $h$ is a column vector in $\mathbb{R}^n$ 

See Thrm 4.3 in [[4.2 Linear transformations and matrix operations]]
## Theorem 8.4
Let ${\bf x}$ be a point in an open subset $U$ of $\mathbb{R}^n$. If $F = (F_1, \cdots, F_m) : U \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^m$ is differentiable at ${\bf x}$, then
$$
D_{{\bf v}} F({\bf x}) = dF_{{\bf x}}({\bf v}) = F'({\bf x}){\bf v}
$$
Furthermore, then $(i, j)$ entry of $F'({\bf x})$ is $\frac{\partial F_i}{\partial x_j} ({\bf x})$. In other words,
$$
F'({\bf x}) = 
\begin{pmatrix}
	\frac{\partial F_1}{\partial x_1}({\bf x}) & \frac{\partial F_1}{\partial x_2}({\bf x}) & \dots & \frac{\partial F_1}{\partial x_n}({\bf x)} \\
	\frac{\partial F_2}{\partial x_1}({\bf x}) & \frac{\partial F_2}{\partial x_2}({\bf x}) & \dots & \frac{\partial F_2}{\partial x_n}({\bf x)} \\
	\vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots \\
	\frac{\partial F_m}{\partial x_1}({\bf x}) & \frac{\partial F_m}{\partial x_2}({\bf x}) & \dots & \frac{\partial F_m}{\partial x_n}({\bf x)} \\
\end{pmatrix}
$$
## 8.4 Jacobian matrix
The above is a Jacobian matrix of $F$ at ${\bf x}$

this is the Jacobian
### Corollary
Suppose $U$ is an open subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$ and $f : U → R$ is a function that is differentiable at some $a ∈ U$ . Then, for every ${\bf 0} = v ∈ \mathbb{R}^n$ we have
$$
D_{{\bf v}}f({\bf a}) = {\bf v} \cdot (D_1f({\bf a}),\dots, D_n f({\bf a}))
$$

## 8.5 Gradient
The gradient of a function $f : U \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, where $U$ is an open subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$ is the function 
$$
\nabla f : U \rightarrow \mathbb{R} \text{ defined by } \nabla f({\bf a}) = (D_1 f({\bf a}), \dots, D_n f({\bf a}))
$$
See [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/multivariable-calculus/multivariable-derivatives/partial-derivative-and-gradient-articles/a/the-gradient) and [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient)

it's just the Jacobian when the function's codomain is in $\mathbb{R}$; the dot product of the $1 \times n$ Jacobian and the $n$ dimensional input vector.

This is a consequence of the fact that the directional derivative of a function at ${\bf a}$ relative to  ${\bf v} \in \mathbb{R}^n$ can be computed via
$$
D_{\bf v}F({\bf a}) = dF_{\bf a}({\bf v}) = J_{{\bf a}} {\bf v}
$$
And we have that this $1 \times n$ Jacobian matrix is composed of the partial derivatives of the one dimensional output $F$ in relation to each of the input variables

This is also
$$
\nabla f({\bf a}) = {\bf v} \cdot \nabla f({\bf a}) = || {\bf v} || \, ||\nabla f({\bf a})|| \, \cos \theta
$$

## 8.6 Direction
A direction is a unit vector, i.e. a vector with length 1. The directional derivative of a function $F$ in the direction of a nonzero vector ${\bf v}$ at point ${\bf a}$ is $D_{\bf u} F ({\bf a})$, where 
$$
{\bf u} = \frac{{\bf v}}{||\, {\bf v} \,||}
$$
Unit vector. Vector over its magnitude
## Theorem 8.5
Let ${\bf a} ∈ U$ , where $U$ is an open subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$. Suppose $f : U → \mathbb{R}$ is differentiable at ${\bf a}$ and that $∇f ({\bf a}) \neq {\bf 0}$. Then, the maximum directional derivative of $f$ at ${\bf a}$ is in the direction of $∇f ({\bf a})$, and this maximum directional derivative is equal to $||∇f ({\bf a})||$. Similarly, the minimum directional derivative of $f$ at ${\bf a}$ is in the direction of $−∇f$ , and this minimum directional derivative is equal to $−||∇f ({\bf a})||$
## 8.7 Continuous differentiability
Let ${\bf a}$ be a point in an open subset $U$ of $\mathbb{R}^n$. A function $F : U → \mathbb{R}^m$ is said to be continuously differentiable at ${\bf a}$ if all partial derivatives $D_1F, . . . , D_nF$ exist on $U$ and they are all continuous at ${\bf a}$.

All entries of $J_F$ are continuous at ${\bf a}$

note this is not iff
## Theorem 8.6
Suppose $U$ is an open subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$. If $F : U → \mathbb{R}^m$ is continuously differentiable at a point ${\bf a} ∈ U$ , then $F$ is differentiable at ${\bf a}$

Like, pretty obviously
## 8.8 Critical points
Suppose $U$ is an open subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$, and $f : U → \mathbb{R}$ is differentiable. A point ${\bf a} ∈ U$ is called a critical point of $f$ , iff $∇f ({\bf a}) = 0$

When gradient = ${\bf 0}$, then that is a critical point
## 8.9 Local minimums
 Let $f : U → \mathbb{R}$ be a function, where $U$ is an open subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$. We say $f$ attains a local minimum (resp., a local maximum) at ${\bf a}$, if there is an open subset $V$ of $U$ for which $f ({\bf a}) ≤ f ({\bf x})$ (resp., $f ({\bf a}) ≥ f ({\bf x}))$ for all ${\bf x} ∈ V$ . If $f$ has a local maximum or a local minimum at a we say $f$ has a local extremum at ${\bf a}$
## Theorem 8.7
Suppose $f : U → \mathbb{R}$ is differentiable, where $U$ is an open subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$. If $f$ attains a local extremum at a point ${\bf a \in U}$ , then ${\bf a}$ is a critical point of $f$ 

Please note that ${\bf a}$ being a critical point **does not** guarantee that $f$ attains an extremum at ${\bf a}$. It could be that ${\bf a}$ is a saddle point of $f$

like $x^3$
### Critical points
A point ${\bf x}$ where 
$$
\nabla f({\bf x}) = {\bf 0}
$$

## 8.10 Tangent plane approximation
 Let $U$ be an open subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$, and $F : U → \mathbb{R}^m$ be differentiable. Suppose ${\bf a} ∈ U$ . Then, the approximation
$$
F({\bf x}) \approx F({\bf a}) + dF_{{\bf a}}({\bf x} - {\bf a})
$$
This is the tangent plane approximation of $F$ near ${\bf a}$
## 8.11 Differential forms
Let $f : U → \mathbb{R}$ be a differentiable function, where $U$ is an open subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$. The function $L$ given by $L({\bf a}) = df_{{\bf a}}$ which assigns to any point ${\bf a}$ the linear transformation $df_{\bf a} : \mathbb{R}^n → \mathbb{R}$ is called a differential form
