Recall that if a point is a local extremum (see 8.8 [[8.2 Derivatives and differentials]]), then it must be a critical point. Let's first look at a simple case when
$$
f(x,y) = ax^2 + 2bxy + cy^2
$$
Such a function is a **quadratic form**. We note that $(0,0)$ is a critical point of this function, and $f(0,0) = 0$. So the question is: under what conditions on $a, b$ can we guarantee that $f(x,y) \geq 0$ for points $(x,y)$ near the origin?

Completing the square, we obtain
$$
f(x,y) = \frac{(ax + by)^2 + (ac - b^2)y^2}{a}
$$
Assuming $a \neq 0$, we have the following:
- If $a > 0$ and $ac - b^2 \geq 0$, then $f(x,y)$ has a global minimum at $(0,0)$
- If $a < 0$ and $ac - b^2 \geq 0$, then $f(x,y)$ has a global maximum at $(0,0)$
- If $ac - b^2 < 0$ then $f(x,y)$ has neither a local minimum nor a local maximum at $(0,0)$
## 9.1 Quadratic forms
A quadratic form is a function $f : \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ given by
$$
f(x_1, \dots, x_n) = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}\sum\limits_{j=1}^{n} a_{ij}x_ix_j \text{, where $a_{ij} \in \mathbb{R}$}
$$
## 9.2 Qualification of quadratic forms
A quadratic form $f$ is called positive definite (resp. positive semidefinite) if $f({\bf x}) > 0$ (resp. $f({\bf x}) \geq 0$) for all ${\bf 0} \neq {\bf x} \in \mathbb{R}^n$. It is called nondefinite if $f$ attains both positive and negative values. Similarly, we say $f$ is negative definite (resp. negative semidefinite) if $f({\bf x}) < 0$ (resp. $f({\bf x}) \leq 0$) for all ${\bf 0} \neq {\bf x} \in \mathbb{R}^n$

The above definition yields the following theorem
## Theorem 9.1
The quadratic form $f(x,y) = ax^2 + 2bxy + cy^2$ is

- positive definite if $a > 0$ and $ac - b^2 > 0$

- negative definite if $a < 0$ and $ac - b^2 > 0$ 

- nondefinite if $ac - b^2 < 0$
## 9.3 Saddle points
Let $U$ be an open subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$. A critical point ${\bf a}$ of a function $f : U \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ i called a saddle point if every open ball containing ${\bf a}$ contains points ${\bf x}, {\bf y} \in \mathbb{R}^n$ for which
$$
f({\bf x}) < f({\bf a}) < f({\bf y})
$$
## Theorem 9.2 Second partials test
Let $f : U \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ be a twice continuously differentiable, where $U$ is an open subset of $\mathbb{R}^2$ . Suppose ${\bf a} \in U$ is a critical point of $f$. Let
$$
\Delta = \frac{\partial^2f}{\partial x^2}({\bf a}) \cdot \frac{\partial^2f}{\partial y^2}({\bf a}) - \left(\frac{\partial^2f}{\partial x \partial y}({\bf a})\right)^2
$$
Then $f$ has

- A local minimum at ${\bf a}$ if $\Delta > 0$ and $\frac{\partial^2f}{\partial x^2}({\bf a}) > 0$

- A local maximum at ${\bf a}$ if $\Delta > 0$ and $\frac{\partial^2f}{\partial x^2}({\bf a}) < 0$

- A saddle point at ${\bf a}$ if $\Delta < 0$
### Note about quadratic forms
To understand quadratic forms on $n$ variables, note that for a quadratic form $f(x_1, \dots, x_n)$ we have
$$
f(cx_1, \dots, cx_n) = c^2f(x_1, \dots, x_n)
$$
Thus, in order to understand if the origin is a local maximum or minimum, we need to understand $f$ over the unit sphere $x_1^2 + \cdots + x_n^2$
