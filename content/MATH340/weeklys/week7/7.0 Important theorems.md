## Theorem 7.1
The open sets in $\mathbb{R}^n$ satisfy the following properties:

1. $\emptyset$ and $\mathbb{R}^n$ are open

2. The union of any collection of open sets is open

3. The intersection of any finite number of sets is open
## Theorem 7.2
A subset $A$ of $\mathbb{R}^n$ is closed if an only if it contains all of its limit points

Useful for checking if a set is closed
## Theorem 7.3 
Closed subsets of $\mathbb{R}^n$ satisfy the following properties

1.  $\emptyset$ and $\mathbb{R}^n$ are closed

2. The union of any finite number of closed sets is closed

3. The intersection of any collection of closed sets is closed

## Theorem 7.4
Let $f : \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^m$ be a function

1. $f$ is continuous iff for any given open subset of $U$ of $\mathbb{R}^m$, the inverse image $f^{-1}(U)$ is an open subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$

2. $f$ is continuous iff if given any closed subset $C$ of $\mathbb{R}^m$ the inverse image $f^{-1}(C)$ is a closed subset $\mathbb{R}^n$

'if a subset in of codomain is open, then its pre-image will also be open'
'if a subset of the codomain is closed, then the pre-image will be closed'

from [[7.3 Compact subsets of Rn]]
## Theorem 7.5 Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem
A subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$ is compact iff it is bounded and closed

- All compact sets are bounded and closed
- If a set is bounded and closed, it is compact
## Theorem 7.6 Extreme Value Theorem
Suppose $A$ is a compact subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$  and $f : A \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is continuous. Then, $f$ attains its maximum and minimum values. In other words, there exist ${\bf x}_0, {\bf y}_o \in A$ for which $f({\bf x}_0) \leq f({\bf x}) \leq f({\bf y}_0)$ for all ${\bf x} \in A$.
