## 7.3 Compact sets
A subset $A$ of $\mathbb{R}^n$ is called compact if every infinite subset of $A$ has a [limit point](6.1%20Limits) which lies in $A$.

Note all compact sets are closed. see [[7.1 Topology of Rn]]
## 7.4 Bounded sets
A subset $A$ of $\mathbb{R}^n$ is said to be bounded if it lies inside some open ball.

**Please note that any bounded set can be said to be bounded by a ball centered at the origin**
## Theorem 7.5 Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem
**A subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$ is compact iff it is bounded and closed**

- All compact sets are bounded and closed
- If a set is bounded and closed, it is compact
## Theorem 7.6 Extreme Value Theorem
Suppose $A$ is a compact subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$  and $f : A \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is continuous. Then, $f$ attains its maximum and minimum values. In other words, there exist ${\bf x}_0, {\bf y}_o \in A$ for which $f({\bf x}_0) \leq f({\bf x}) \leq f({\bf y}_0)$ for all ${\bf x} \in A$.
