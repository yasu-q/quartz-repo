problem 5:
We want to show that any $\mathbb{R}$ can be approached from $\mathbb{Q}$ like
$$
a \in \mathbb{R} \text{ show } Q_1,...\rightarrow a
$$
So long as this sequence will not contain $a$ itself. Formally, we want to show that every ball around $a$ will contain some $\mathbb{Q}$ 

We want to find some rational that will be a rational within a given region of $a$ but will not be $a$ itself.
$$
\forall a \in \mathbb{R},\exists q \in \mathbb{Q} \text{ s.t. } q \in B_r(a), \forall r>0
$$
