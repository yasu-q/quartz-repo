## 6.6 Continuity
Let ${\bf a}$ be a limit point of a subset $D$ of $\mathbb{R}^n$. We say a function $f : D → \mathbb{R}^m$ is continuous at a if $\lim\limits_{{\bf x}→{\bf a}} f (x) = f ({\bf a})$. If $f$ is continuous at every point inside its domain we say $f$ is continuous on its domain

same ol definition. 
## Theorem 6.4
 Let $D$ be a subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$, and ${\bf a}$ be a limit point of $D$. The function $f : D → \mathbb{R}^m$ is continuous at a if and only if each coordinate function of $f$ is continuous at ${\bf a}$

## Theorem 6.5
Suppose $D_1$ and $D_2$ are subsets of $\mathbb{R}^n$ and $\mathbb{R}^m$, respectively. Let $f : D_1 → \mathbb{R}^m$, and $g : D_2 → \mathbb{R}^k$ be two functions. Let ${\bf a}$ be a limit point of $D_1$, and a limit point of the domain of $g ◦ f$ . Suppose $\lim\limits_{x→a} f ({\bf x}) = {\bf b}$, and ${\bf b} ∈ D_2$, and that $g$ is continuous at ${\bf b}$. Then $\lim\limits_{x→a} g ◦ f ({\bf x}) = g({\bf b})$

## Theorem 6.6
Let $D$ be a subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$, and ${\bf a}$ be a limit of $D$. Suppose $f,g : D \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ are functions, then 
$$
\lim\limits_{{\bf x} \rightarrow {\bf a}} (f({\bf x}) + g({\bf x})) = \lim\limits_{{\bf x} \rightarrow {\bf a}} (f({\bf x})) + \lim\limits_{{\bf x} \rightarrow {\bf a}} (g({\bf x}))
$$
And
$$
\lim\limits_{{\bf x} \rightarrow {\bf a}} (f({\bf x})g({\bf x})) = \lim\limits_{{\bf x} \rightarrow {\bf a}} (f({\bf x}))  \lim\limits_{{\bf x} \rightarrow {\bf a}} (g({\bf x}))
$$
