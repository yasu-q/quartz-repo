### Approachability
In order to be able to define limit of a function at a given point, we need to be able to approach that point. For example consider the following function
$$
f(x)=
\left\{\begin{array}{c}
	x + 1 & \text{if } x <0 \\
	2 & \text{if } x =1 \\
	2x-1 & \text{if } 2 \leq x
\end{array}\right.
$$

The domain of this function is $(−∞, 0) ∪ {1} ∪ [2, ∞)$. Since the only points close to zero inside the domain are less than 0, we can only talk about $\lim\limits{x→0^−} f (x)$, and not $\lim\limits_{x→0^+} f (x)$. The point x = 1 is an isolated point, so we cannot talk about any meaningful limit at x = 1, and for x = 2 we can only talk about the limit from the right. This motivates the following definition:
## 6.1 Approachability
Let $a$ be a point in $\mathbb{R}^n$. The open ball of radius $r$ centered at $a$ is defined by 
$$
B_r(a) = \{{\bf x} \in \mathbb{R}^n \space | \space ||{\bf x}-{\bf a}|| < r\}
$$
The closed ball is the same, it just includes the edges
$$
B_r(a) = \{{\bf x} \in \mathbb{R}^n \space | \space ||{\bf x}-{\bf a}|| \leq r\}
$$
Like, all the points at a distance less the $r$, meaning they are 'in' the ball. Note that this is under the standard Euclidean norm
### Notes
- $||{\bf x} - {\bf a}|| < 0$ is not possible, see positivity in [[4.1 Norms]].
- The set $B_0({\bf a})$ is $\emptyset$ 
- $\overset{-}{B}_0({\bf a}) = {\bf a}$ (closed ball)
## 6.2 Limit point
Let $D$ be a subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$. A point ${\bf a} \in \mathbb{R}^n$ is called a limit point of $D$ iff every open ball centered at ${\bf a}$ contains AT LEAST one point of $D$ that is not ${\bf a}$ 
## 6.3 Delta epsilon definition of a limit
Let $D$ be a subset of $\mathbb{R}^n, f : D → \mathbb{R}^m$ be a function, $a ∈ \mathbb{R}^n$ be a limit point of $D$, and $b ∈ \mathbb{R}^m$. We say $b$ is the limit of $f$ at $a$, written $\lim\limits_{x→a} f (x) = b$, iff for every $ϵ > 0$, there is $δ > 0$ such that if for some $x ∈ D$, we have $0 < ||x − a|| < δ$, then $||f (x) − b|| < ϵ.$ If no such $b$ exists we say $f$ does not have a limit at $a$ or the limit does not exist

Notes:
- We say $0 < ||x − a||$ to exclude $x = a$
- relevant [khan vid](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-calculus-ab/ab-limits-new/ab-limits-optional/v/epsilon-delta-definition-of-limits#:~:text=Explore%20the%20epsilon%2Ddelta%20definition,L%20is%20less%20than%20%CE%B5.)

"For any small positive number $\epsilon$ (no matter how small), you can find a corresponding small positive number $\delta$ such that whenever $x$ is within $\delta$ of $c$ (but not equal to $c$), the value of $f(x)$ is within $\epsilon$ of $L$."

 Note that since the limit of a function at a only depends on the functional values near $a$, i.e. on an open ball centered at $a$, if two functions $f$ and $g$ are the same near $a$, except possibly at $a$, then their limits at $a$ are the same
## 6.4 Limit of a sequence
Let ${\bf x}_k \in \mathbb{R}^n$, for $k = 1,2, \dots$ be a sequence and ${\bf a} \in \mathbb{R}^n$. We say ${\bf x}_k$ converges to ${\bf a}$, denoted as the following: ${\bf x}_k \rightarrow {\bf a}$ iff the following holds:
$$
\forall \epsilon > 0, \exists N \in \mathbb{N} \text{ such that } \forall k \in \mathbb{N}, \text{ if } k \geq N, \text{ then }  ||{\bf x}_k - {\bf a}|| < \epsilon 
$$
Basically, for every $\epsilon > 0$ (so like any really smaller number too), then the difference between ${\bf x}_k$ and ${\bf a}$ is less than the $\epsilon$ after some arbitrary $N$th term

## Example 6.2
Prove that $\lim\limits_{x \rightarrow 1} 3x+2 = 5$ . TF DO YOU MEAN "PROVE"

Rewrite the $\delta-\epsilon$  definition for this limit:
$\forall \epsilon > 0$, $\exists \delta > 0$ such that $0 < |x - 1 | < \delta$ where $|3x + 2 - 5| < \epsilon$ 

Find a $\delta$ where the region around 1 will contain a value for x such that $3x+2$ is bounded by $\epsilon$ ==Basically, we want to find $\delta$ in terms of $\epsilon$== 
- $|3x + 2 -5| < \epsilon \Rightarrow |3x -3| < \epsilon$ 
Find some $\delta$ such that $0 < |x - 1| < \delta$ will respect $|3x - 3| < \epsilon$.
Ok, now the work
$$
|3x-3| < \epsilon \Rightarrow 3|x - 1| < \epsilon
$$
So, what delta will fulfill this? $3\delta$ since
$$
0<|x -1| < \delta \xRightarrow{\text{multiply by } 3} 0 < 3|x-1| < 3\delta
$$
So a valid delta, in terms of $\epsilon$ would be $\frac{\epsilon}{3}$.

### Formal solution
Let $\epsilon > 0$ and set $\delta = \frac{\epsilon}{3}$ . Assume $0  < |x - 1| < \delta$ 
$$
|3x + 2- 5| = |3x - 3| = 3|x-1|< 3\delta = \epsilon
$$
Meaning $|3x + 2 - 5| < \epsilon$. This implies that indeed, $\lim\limits_{x \rightarrow 1} 3x+2 = 5$ by the definition of a limit

Basically, pick any $\epsilon > 0$, we can pick a $\delta = \frac{\epsilon}{3}$ that will contain a value of $x$ for $f(x)$ around $1$ from both sides (the absolute value) and it will always be between $5$ and an $\epsilon$ away from $5$

## Theorem 6.1
Suppose $D$ is a subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$ , $a$ is a limit point of $D$, and $f : D → \mathbb{R}^m$ is a function. If there are two sequences ${\bf x}_k, {\bf y}_k ∈ D − {a}$ for which ${\bf x}_k → a$ and ${\bf y}_k → a$, but the limits $\lim\limits_{ k→∞ }f ({\bf x}_k)$ and $\lim\limits_{k→∞} f ({\bf y}_k)$ are not the same. Then $\lim\limits_{x→a} f (x)$ does not exist

## 6.5 Coordinate functions
Given a function $f : D → \mathbb{R}^m$, where $D$ is a subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$, we write $f = (f_1, . . . , f_m)$ if $f (x) = (f_1(x), . . . , f_m(x))$ for all $x ∈ D$, and we say functions $f_1, . . . , f_m$ from $D$ to $\mathbb{R}$ are coordinate functions of $f$. 

They are like the individual components of $f$ 
## Theorem 6.2
Let $D$ be a subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$, and ${\bf a}$ be a limit point of $D$, and ${\bf b} = (b_1, . . . , b_m) ∈ \mathbb{R}^m$. Assume $f = (f_1, . . . , f_m) : D → \mathbb{R}^m$ is a function. Then $\lim\limits_{x→a} f (x) = {\bf b}$ if and only if $\lim\limits_{x→a} f_i(x) = b_i,$ for all $i = 1, . . . , m.$ 

i.e. $f$ will only approach ${\bf b}$ if the $f's$ $i$th coordinate function will approach ${\bf b}$'s $b_i$ component
## Theorem 6.3 Squeeze theorem
Suppose $D$ is a subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$, and ${\bf a}$ is a limit point of $D$. Let $f,g,h : D \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ be functions for which
$$
f({\bf x}) \leq g({\bf x}) \leq h({\bf x}) \text{ for all } {\bf x} \in D - \{{\bf a}\}
$$
If $\lim\limits_{{\bf x} \rightarrow {\bf a}} f({\bf x}) = \lim\limits_{{\bf x} \rightarrow {\bf a}} h({\bf x}) = L$ for some real number $L$, then $\lim\limits_{{\bf x} \rightarrow {\bf a}} g({\bf x}) = L$ 
Yes this is the normal [squeeze theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squeeze_theorem)
