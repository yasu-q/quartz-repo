## Theorem 6.3 Squeeze theorem
Suppose $D$ is a subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$, and ${\bf a}$ is a limit point of $D$. Let $f,g,h : D \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ be functions for which
$$
f({\bf x}) \leq g({\bf x}) \leq h({\bf x}) \text{ for all } {\bf x} \in D - \{{\bf a}\}
$$
If $\lim\limits_{{\bf x} \rightarrow {\bf a}} f({\bf x}) = \lim\limits_{{\bf x} \rightarrow {\bf a}} h({\bf x}) = L$ for some real number $L$, then $\lim\limits_{{\bf x} \rightarrow {\bf a}} g({\bf x}) = L$ 
Yes this is the normal [squeeze theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squeeze_theorem)
## Theorem 6.1
Suppose $D$ is a subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$ , $a$ is a limit point of $D$, and $f : D → \mathbb{R}^m$ is a function. If there are two sequences ${\bf x}_k, {\bf y}_k ∈ D − {a}$ for which ${\bf x}_k → a$ and ${\bf y}_k → a$, but the limits $\lim\limits_{ k→∞ }f ({\bf x}_k)$ and $\lim\limits_{k→∞} f ({\bf y}_k)$ are not the same. Then $\lim\limits_{x→a} f (x)$ does not exist

Lets us say that if a limit is not the same approaching it from different lines, then it DNE

from [[6.2 Continuity]]
## Theorem 6.4
 Let $D$ be a subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$, and ${\bf a}$ be a limit point of $D$. The function $f : D → \mathbb{R}^m$ is continuous at a if and only if each coordinate function of $f$ is continuous at ${\bf a}$ 
## Theorem 6.7 Continuous functions
These single-variable real-valued functions are known to be continuous on their domain
- Polynomial and root functions
- Rational functions
- Trigonometric functions and inverses
- Exponential functions and inverse
from examples
- Projection functions
- Product
- Sum

this section also has properties of lims but I  don't have to cite them when applying them, im pretty sure
