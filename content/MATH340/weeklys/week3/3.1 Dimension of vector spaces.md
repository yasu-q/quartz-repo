## Theorem 3.1   
Assume $V$ is a subspace of $\mathbb{R}^n$. Then, there is an integer $m â‰¤ n$ for which $V$ has a basis consisting of $m$ distinct vectors. Furthermore, every basis of $V$ contains precisely $m$ vectors
 
i.e. we can make a basis for $V$ which is a subspace of $\mathbb{R}^n$ using exactly $m$ vectors where $m \leq n$ the number of dimensions

please note, all these vectors are linearly independent by the definition of a basis
## 3.1 Dimension of a vector space
A subspace $V$ of $\mathbb{R}^n$ is said to have dimension $m$ (denoted as $\text{dim}V=m$), if it has a basis of size $m$
i.e. how many vectors are in the basis of $V$?
## Theorem 3.2
Let $V$ be a subspace of $\mathbb{R}^n$ of dimension $m$. Then:

- Every $m$ linearly independent vectors in $V$ form a basis for $V$
- Every $m$ spanning vectors in $V$ form a basis for $V$

### Example 3.2
Show that all subspaces of $\mathbb{R}^2$ are either $\{0\}$, lines through the origin, or $\mathbb{R}^2$ itself.

Let $V$ be a subspace of $\mathbb{R}^2$
- Either dim$V$ is 0, 1, or 2.

(i) if **dim**$V = 0$ then $\emptyset$ is a basis of $V$ meaning $V$ is **span**$\emptyset$ i.e. $V = {0}$ 
 
(ii) if **dim**$V = 1$ then $V = \text{span\{a,b\}}$ where $a,b \neq 0$  which is a line through the origin.

(iii) if **dim**$V = 2$ this means that $V = \text{span}\{ \vec{a} ,\vec{b} \}$ where $\vec{a},\vec{b}$ are linearly independent. We know 
**dim**$\mathbb{R}^2$ is 2 which implies that $\vec{a},\vec{b}$ are a basis of $\vec{a},\vec{b}$ meaning $\text{span}\{\vec{a},\vec{b}\} = \mathbb{R}^2 = V$. $V$ is the span of these two vectors btw.
