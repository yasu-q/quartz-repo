## Theorem 3.1   
Assume $V$ is a subspace of $\mathbb{R}^n$. Then, there is an integer $m â‰¤ n$ for which $V$ has a basis consisting of $m$ distinct vectors. Furthermore, every basis of $V$ contains precisely $m$ vectors
 
i.e. we can make a basis for $V$ which is a subspace of $\mathbb{R}^n$ using exactly $m$ vectors where $m \leq n$ the number of dimensions
## Theorem 3.2
Let $V$ be a subspace of $\mathbb{R}^n$ of dimension $m$. Then:

- Every $m$ linearly independent vectors in $V$ form a basis for $V$
- Every $m$ spanning vectors in $V$ form a basis for $V$

## Theorem 3.3 
Let $A$ be a matrix

- The **dimension of Row($A$)** is ==**equal to the number of pivot entries of the echelon form**== of $A$. Furthermore, the nonzero rows of the echelon form of A form a basis for Row($A$). 
- The dimension of Col($A$) is equal to the number of pivot entries of the echelon form of $A$. Furthermore, the pivot columns of $A$ form a basis for Col($A$)

i.e. **dim**(Row($A$)) = **dim**(Col($A$))

## Theorem 3.5 Pythagorean Theorem
If vectors $\vec{v}, \vec{w} \in \mathbb{R}^n$ are orthogonal relative to an inner product of $\mathbb{R}^n$. then 
$$
||\vec{v}||^2 + ||\vec{w}||^2 = ||\vec{v} + \vec{w}||^2
$$
## Theorem 3.6 Cauchy-Schwarz inequality
Given an inner product $\langle,\rangle$ of $\mathbb{R}^n$, we have
$$
\langle \vec{v}, \vec{w}\rangle \leq ||\vec{v}|| \space ||\vec{w}||
$$
