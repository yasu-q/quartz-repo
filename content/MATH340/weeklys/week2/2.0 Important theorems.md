## Theorem 2.1 Criteria for a subspace
A subset $W$ of $\mathbb{R}^n$ is a subspace if and only if it satisfies all of the following:
- $W$ contains the zero vector
- for all $\vec{x},\vec{y} \in W \text{ and } c \in \mathbb{R}$, we have $\vec{x} + \vec{y} \in W \text{ and } c\vec{x} \in W$. (We say $W$ is closed under vector addition and scalar multiplication)

### Theorem 2.2
The vectors $\vec{v}_1,...\vec{v}_m \in \mathbb{R}^n$ are linearly dependent if and only if there are real numbers $c_1,...,c_m$ (they can't all be zero) such that $c_1 \vec{v}_1 + c_2 \vec{v}_2 + ... + c_m\vec{v}_m=\vec{0}$. 

In other words., vectors $\vec{v}_1,\vec{v}_2,...,\vec{v}_m$ are independent if and only if the following is also true:
$$
\text{If } c_1\vec{v}_1+c_2\vec{v}_2+...+c_m\vec{v}_m=\vec{0} \text{ for some scalars } c_1,c_2,...,c_m \text{ then } c_1=c_2=...=c_m=0
$$

### Theorem 2.3 
Let $V$ be a subspace $\mathbb{R}^n$. Vectors $\vec{v}_1,\vec{v}_2,...,\vec{v}_m \in V$ form a basis for $V$ if and only if every vector $\vec{w} \in V$ can be uniquely written as 
$$
\vec{w} = c_1\vec{v}_1+c_2\vec{v}_2+...+c_m\vec{v}_m
$$


from [[2.4 System of Linear Equations]]
## Theorem 2.4
Every matrix can be turned into a matrix in reduced echelon form by applying the three elementary row operations. Furthermore, the reduced echelon form for any matrix is unique
## Theorem 2.5 
Any homogenous system that has less equations than variables has a nontrivial solution
### Corollary
Every $n+1$ vectors in $\mathbb{R}^n$ are linearly dependent
