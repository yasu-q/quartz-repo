While lengths can be defined by an inner product, they can also be defined independently. We can defined the "norm" (or length) to be an assignment of non-negative real numbers to vectors that satisfies certain properties that we expect 
## 4.1 Norm
A norm on $\mathbb{R}^n$ is a function that assigns to any vector $\vec{v} \in \mathbb{R}^n$ a nonnegative real number $||\vec{v}||$ that satisfies all of the following:

1. $||\vec{v}|| \gt 0$ for every non zero $\vec{v} \in \mathbb{R}^n$ (Positivity)

2. $||\vec{v} + \vec{w}|| \leq ||\vec{v}|| + ||\vec{w}||$ for every $\vec{v}, \vec{w} \in \mathbb{R}^n$ (Triangle Inequality)

3. $||c\vec{v}|| = |c| \space ||\vec{v}||$ for every $\vec{v} \in \mathbb{R}^n$ and $c \in \mathbb{R}$ (Homogeneity)

The following theorem connect the notion of norms and inner products:
## Theorem 4.1
If ⟨, ⟩ is an inner product on $\mathbb{R}^n$, then the function defined by $||\vec{v}|| = \sqrt{⟨\vec{v}, \vec{v}⟩}$ is a norm

When a specific norm is not mentioned, we standard Euclidean norm is utilized (dot product)
