### Notations
- Epsilon: $x\in A$ or 'x is an element of set A'
- Subset: $A \subseteq B$ or 'all elements of A are included within B, but A $\neq$ B'
- Union: $A \cup B$ or 'all elements contained within A, B, or both'
- Intersection: $A \cap B$ or 'all elements contained within A AND B'
### Definition
A set is a [well-defined](https://web.mnstate.edu/peil/MDEV102/U1/S2/Welldefined2.htm#:~:text=A%20set%20is%20well%2Ddefined,what%20is%20in%20the%20set.) collection of **unordered elements**.
$$
\large{S=\{s_1,s_2,s_3,...s_n\}} \space\space or \space\space S=\{s \space | \space s \space \text{satifies a condition} \space P\}
$$
such as
$$
\large{S=\{s \space | \space 0, \pm2,\pm4,\pm6,...\}} = \{2n \space | \space n \in \mathbb{Z} \}
$$
==**Note that the order of elements and repetition do not matter.**== {1,1,2} and {2,1} represent the **same** set
### Subsets
Let A and B be two sets for which the following statement is true:
$$
\large{\text{If } x \in A \text{, then } x \in B}
$$
Then we say that A is a subset of B. 
$$
\large{A \subseteq B}
$$
A subset is **proper** if. Check paper for notation
$$
\large{A \subseteq B\text{ but } A \neq B }
$$
## 1.1 Unions & Intersections
The **union** of A and B is the set consisting of all elements that are in A or B **==(or both)==**
The **intersection** of A and B is the set consisting of all elements that are both in A and B
$$
A \cup B = \{x \text{ | } x \in A \text{, or }x\in B\} \space\space\text{ and } \space\space A \cap B = \{x \text{ | } x \in A \text{, and }x\in B\}
$$
Note how the only difference between unions and intersections if the condition 'or' a/ 'and'. Interesting connection between unions and intersections, see vid in [[home]]

The union and intersection of $n$ sets is defined similarly:
$$
{\bigcup\limits_{i=1}^{n} A_{i}=\{x \text{ | } x \in A_i \text{, for some i}\}} \space\space \text{ and } \space\space {\bigcap\limits_{i=1}^{n} A_{i}=\{x \text{ | } x \in A_i \text{, for all i}\}}
$$
Once again, note that the only differences are the words 'some' and 'all'.
- Unions are inclusive
- Intersections are exclusive
- Unions 'max'
- Intersections 'min'
Once again, please check out the video in [[home]]

Additionally, w/ this notation you care express the union and intersection of infinitely many sets
$$
\bigcup\limits_{i=1}^{\infty} A_{i} \text{ and } \bigcap\limits_{i=1}^{\infty} A_{i}
$$
### The empty set
The empty set or the null set is the set with no elements. It is denoted by ∅ or {}. 
$$
\large{\emptyset} \text{ or } \{\}
$$
### 1.2 Equality between sets
We say two sets $A$ and $B$ are **equal** IAOF $A \subseteq B$ AND $B \subseteq A$, meaning $A=B$.
- i.e. A is contained within B AND B is contained within A
***
## Example 1.1 
Prove that that for every three sets, or three generic sets, A, B, and C
$$
(A \cup B) \cap C=(A \cap C) \cup(B \cap C)
$$
**==Solution:==**
To prove that the set $(A \cup B) \cap C$ is equivalent to $(A \cap C) \cup(B \cap C)$ we must show that the two are subsets of one another (via the definition of set equality, see [1.2]()). i.e.
$$
x \in (A \cup B) \cap C \iff x \in (A \cap C) \cup(B \cap C)
$$

### Part 1
Let $x \in (A \cup B) \cap C \Rightarrow$ By def. of intersection then $x \in A \cup B \space \text{ and } \space x \in C$
By the definition of a union (see [1.1]()), then $(x \in A \vee x \in B) \wedge x \in C$, both statements being true

There are two cases for where $x$ is:

**Case**  $x \in A$: Since $x \in C$, by the definition of an intersection then:
$$
x \in A \cap C \Rightarrow x \in (A \cap C) \cup(B \cap C)
$$
Since $x$ is in $A$, then the statement $x \in (A \cap C) \cup(B \cap C)$ is true since $x \in (A \cap C)$ is true.
Note that $x \in (A \cap C)$ is $x \in (A \cup B) \cap C$, just we are evaluating when $x$ is within $A$ in this case. 
///
**Case**  $x \in B$: Since $x \in C$, by the definition of an intersection then:
$$
x \in B \cap C \Rightarrow x \in (A \cap C) \cup(B \cap C)
$$
Since $x$ is in $B$, then the statement $x \in (A \cap C) \cup(B \cap C)$ is true since $x \in (B \cap C)$ is true.

==**Notice how both cases have the same outcome and are proved in the same manner. They are symmetric**==

By demonstrating 
$$
x \in A \cap C \Rightarrow x \in (A \cap C) \cup(B \cap C)
$$
$$
x \in B \cap C \Rightarrow x \in (A \cap C) \cup(B \cap C)
$$
i.e.
$$
x \in (A \cup B) \cap C \Rightarrow x \in (A \cap C) \cup(B \cap C)
$$
It can be determined that
$$
(A \cup B) \cap C \subseteq (A \cap C) \cup(B \cap C)
$$
This provides the first half of the proof.
### Part 2
Now, let $x \in (A \cap C) \cup (B \cap C)$. By the definition of a union, $x \in A \cap C \vee x \in B \cap C$

Case $x \in A \cap C$: $x \in A \wedge x \in C$ by the definition of an intersection. This thus implies that 
$$
x \in (A \cup B) \wedge x \in C
$$
By the definition of a union. Thus: $\Rightarrow x \in (A \cup B) \cap C$ (this is the left side)
///
Case $x \in B \cap C$: $x \in B \wedge x \in C$ by the definition of an intersection. This thus implies that 
$$
x \in (A \cup B) \wedge x \in C
$$
By the definition of a union. Thus: $\Rightarrow x \in (A \cup B) \cap C$ (this is the left side)

By showing how both cases result in the same outcome (x being contained both constructions), it can be said that:
$$
(A \cap C) \cup(B \cap C) \subseteq (A \cup B) \cap C
$$
THUS, FINALLY, it can be said that the two are equal by the definition of set equality (see [1.2]())
$$
(A \cap C) \cup(B \cap C) \subseteq (A \cup B) \cap C \wedge (A \cup B) \cap C \subseteq (A \cap C) \cup(B \cap C)
$$
$$
(A \cup B) \cap C=(A \cap C) \cup(B \cap C)
$$

## 1.3 Ordered pairs
An ordered pair $(a,b)$ is two objects $a$ and $b$ with a **SPECIFIED** order. Thus $(a,b) \neq (b,a)$ assuming $a \neq b$. Similarly, an $n$-tuple $(a_1,a_2,a_3,...a_n)$ is $n$ objects with a **specified** order. This is very much unlike a set in which order **does not matter**
## 1.4 Cartesian product
The Cartesian product of n sets $A_1, A_2, . . . , A_n$, denoted by $A_1 × A_2 × · · · × A_n$, is the set of all $n$-tuples $(a_1, a_2, . . . , a_n)$ for which $a_i \in A_i$ for all $i$. The Cartesian product of n copies of a set $A$ is denoted by $A_n$. See [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufjEv-5nmcA&ab_channel=Dr.TreforBazett) 

Basically, let $A = \{1, 2\} \text{ and } B = \{3, 4\}$, then $A \times B$ is a set of pairs (2-tuples):
$$
\{(1,3),(1,4),(2,3),(2,4)\}
$$
***
## Example 1.2
Every pt. of the x-y plane can be represented by an element of the set $\mathbb{R}^2 = \{(x, y) \text{ | } x,y \in \mathbb{R}\}$. More generally, every point on $n$-dimensional space can be represented as an element of the set
$$
\mathbb{R}^n=\{(x_1,...,x_n\ \text{ | } x_1,...,x_n \in \mathbb{R}\}
$$
***
## 1.5 Disjoint sets 
Two sets $A$ and $B$ are **disjoint** if $A \cap B = \emptyset$. This also applies the intersection of multiple sets. Multiple sets are pairwise disjoint if none of them intersect at any pt.
Also note that
$$
\text{pairwise disjoint} \Rightarrow \text{disjoint}
$$
## 1.6 Difference between sets
For two sets $A$ and $B$, the difference $A-B$ is the set consisting of all elements of $A$ that are not present within $B$. i.e.
$$
A - B = \{x \in A \text{ | } x \notin B\}
$$
The complement of a set is given by $U-A$, where $U$ is the **universal set**. $U$ varies by context, but within set theory $U$ is usually $\mathbb{Z}$. The complement of a set $A$ is denoted by $A^c$
## Theorem 1.1 De Morgan's Laws
Given n subsets $A_1,...,A_n$ of a universal set $U$, it can be said that
$$
( \bigcap\limits_{j=1}^{n} A_{j})^c = \bigcup\limits_{j=1}^{n} A_{j}^c \space\space \text{ or } \space\space (A \cap B)^c = A^c \cup B^c
$$
$$
( \bigcup\limits_{j=1}^{n} A_{j})^c = \bigcap\limits_{j=1}^{n} A_{j}^c \space\space \text{ or } \space\space (A \cup B)^c = A^c \cap B^c
$$
### Proof of first law
Show that $(A \cap B)^c = A^c \cup B^c$ by showing that $x \in (A \cap B)^c \iff x \in  A^c \cup B^c$

Let $x \in (A \cap B)^c$ , then by the definition of a comp liment (see [1.6]()), $x \notin A \cap B$,
$\iff$ By the definition of a intersection, $x \notin A \space\space \text{or} \space\space x \notin B$
$\iff$ By the definition of a compliment, $x \in A^c \text{ or } x \in B^c$
$\iff$ And by the definition of a union, $x \in A^c \cup B^c$

Thus, $(A \cap B)^c = A^c \cup B^c$
