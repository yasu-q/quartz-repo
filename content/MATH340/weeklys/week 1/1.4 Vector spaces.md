As seen earlier (please see [[1.1 Sets]]), elements of $\mathbb{R}^n$ are $n$-tuples of the form $(x_1,x_2,...x_n)$ where $x$ components are real numbers. Each on one of these elements if called a vector.

## Vector operations
### Addition
Say we have two vectors $\vec{a}$ and $\vec{b}$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ such that $\vec{a} = (x_1,x_2,...,x_n)$ and $\vec{b}=(y_1,y_2,...y_n)$. When we add $\vec{a}$ with $\vec{b}$, we operate on the components are follows:
$$
\vec{a} + \vec{b}=(x_1,x_2,...,x_n) + (y_1,y_2,...,y_n) = (x_1+y_1,x_2+y_2,...,x_n+y_n)
$$
The resultant of this operation is another vector within $\mathbb{R}^n$
### Scalar multiplication
Consider the vector $\vec{a} = (x_1,x_2,...,x_n)$. When we multiply $\vec{a}$ by a value $c$ such that $c \in \mathbb{R}$ we operate on the components of $\vec{a}$ as follows:
$$
c\vec{a}=c(x_1,x_2,...,x_n)=(cx_1,cx_2,...,cx_n)
$$
### Properties 
These operations satisfy the following properties;

1. **Closure**:
- For every two vectors $\vec{a} , \vec{b} \in \mathbb{R}^n$ , and every scalar $c \in \mathbb{R}$, both $\vec{a} + \vec{b}$ and $c\vec{a}$ are within $\mathbb{R}^n$

2. **Associativity**:
- For every $\vec{a} , \vec{b} , \vec{c} \in \mathbb{R}^n$. Then $\vec{a} + (\vec{b} + \vec{c}) = (\vec{a} + \vec{b}) + \vec{c}$. 
- Also consider the past vectors; for every $x,y \in R$, then $x(y\vec{a}) = (xy)\vec{a}$

3. **Commutativity**
- For every $\vec{a},\vec{b} \in \mathbb{R}^n$, we have $\vec{a} + \vec{b} = \vec{b} + \vec{a}$

4. **Additive identity**
- For every $\vec{a} \in \mathbb{R}^n$ we have $\vec{a} + (0,0,...0_n) = \vec{a}$. 
- i.e. if we add a vector with all components 0 to $\vec{a}$ then nothing happens

5. **Additive inverse**
- For every $\vec{a} \in \mathbb{R}^n$, there is a vector $\vec{b} \in \mathbb{R}^n$ for which $\vec{a} + \vec{b} = 0$
- This vector $\vec{b}$ is called the additive inverse of $\vec{a}$ and is denoted as $-\vec{a}$. ($-1\vec{a}$)

6. **Distributivity**
- For every $x,y \in \mathbb{R}$ and $\vec{a},\vec{b} \in \mathbb{R}^n$, we have $(x+y)\vec{a} = x\vec{a} + y\vec{a}$ and $x(\vec{x} + \vec{y} = x\vec{a} + x\vec{b})$ 

7. **Multiplicative Identity**
- For every $\vec{a} \in \mathbb{R}^n$ we have $1\vec{a} = \vec{a}$ 

There seven properties are called vector space properties of $\mathbb{R}^n$. This is often phrased as "$\mathbb{R}$" is a vector space. Note that sometimes we refer to elements of $\mathbb{R}^n$ as points. This is only for conceptualizing these objects. The math does not change. When elements of $\mathbb{R}^n$ are seen as points, the zero vector is referred to as the origin. 

### Geometric intuition
Please see [relevant 3blue1brown video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNk_zzaMoSs&list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab&ab_channel=3Blue1Brown)

Geometrically, elements of $\mathbb{R}^2$ can be represented by points on the cartesian plane. Elements in $\mathbb{R}^3$ can be represented by points in 3D space, and so on. 

To represents points in 3D space, we need a system of x-y-z axes that satisfy the right-hand rule. There re three planes containing two of the x-y-z axes. Each of the three xy-xz-yz planes is a coordinate plane.
### Theorem 1.3 The distance formula for $\mathbb{R}^3$
The distance between two points $a,b \in \mathbb{R}^3$ is given by:
$$
\sqrt{(x_1-x_2)^2+(y_2-y_1)^2+(z_1-z_2)^2}
$$

$$
x^2 \text{ is irrational } \Rightarrow x \text{ also irrational}
$$
$$
x \text{ is rational } \Rightarrow x^2 \text{ is also rational}
$$
sqrt(x^2) = |x|

if we can say that $\sqrt{ \text{an irrational} } = \text{another irrational}$

Rational numbers can not be the square root of an irrational number thus if x^2 is irrational, then x must also be irrational as x = sqrt{x^2} i.e. the square root of an irrational
