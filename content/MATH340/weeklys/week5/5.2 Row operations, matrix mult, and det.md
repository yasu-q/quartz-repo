The outcome of each row operation to matrix $A$ is a matrix $EA$ as follows:
If its a row operation
1. Interchange rows

2. Multiply a row by a scalar

3. Add the scalar of another row to a row

THESE ARE THE ELEMNTARY MATRICES
## 5.3 Elementary matrix
Any matrix $E$ of one the forms above is called an elementary matrix

Combining the above and **Theorem 5.1** we conclude that $\det (EA) = \det(E) \det(A)$ for every $n \times n$ matrix $A$ and $n \times n$ matrix $E$ as above.
## Theorem 5.3
Let $A$ an $B$ be two $n \times n$ matrices, then $\det(AB) = (\det A)(\det B)$
### Corollary
For every square matrix $A$, we have $\det(A^T) = \det A$.

Determinants can be evaluated using co-factor expansion. Here is an example

This means that we can re-write a $3 \times 3$ matrix $A$ as follows:

$$
\det A = a_{11}\det A_{11} - a_{12} A_{12} + a_{13} \det A_{13}
$$

Where $A_{ij}$ is obtained by removing the $i$th row and the $j$th row of $A$

You can show this is valid via linearity.
## Theorem 5.4 Cofactor expansion
(Cofactor Expansion Along a Row or a Column) Let $A = (a_{ij})n×n$ be an $n × n$ matrix with $a_{ij}$ as its $(i, j)$ entry. Then, for every $i$ with $1 ≤ i ≤ n$, we have
$$
\det A = \sum\limits_{j=1}^{n} a_{ij} \det A_{ij}
$$

## 5.4 Invertibility of a matrix
A square matrix $A$ is called invertible or nonsingular if there is a square matrix $B$ for which $AB = BA = I$. $A$ matrix that is not invertible is said to be singular. It is denoted as $A^{-1}$
## Theorem 5.5
For a square matrix $A$, the following are equivalent:

1. $A$ is invertible

2. $\det A \neq 0$

3. Rows of $A$ are linearly independent

4. Columns of $A$ are linearly independent
