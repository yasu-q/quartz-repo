from [[5.2 Row operations, matrix mult, and det]]
## Theorem 5.3
Let $A$ an $B$ be two $n \times n$ matrices, then $\det(AB) = (\det A)(\det B)$
### Corollary
For every square matrix $A$, we have $\det(A^T) = \det A$.
## Theorem 5.5
For a square matrix $A$, the following are equivalent:

1. $A$ is invertible

2. $\det A \neq 0$

3. Rows of $A$ are linearly independent

4. Columns of $A$ are linearly independent
