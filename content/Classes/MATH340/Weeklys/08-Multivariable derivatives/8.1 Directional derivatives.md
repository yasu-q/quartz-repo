## 8.1 Directional derivatives
Let ${\bf a}$  be a point in an open subset $U$ of $\mathbb{R}^n$ and $F : U → \mathbb{R}^m$ be a function, and ${\bf 0} \neq {\bf v} ∈ \mathbb{R}^n$. The directional derivative of $F$ with respect to ${\bf v}$ at a is defined by
$$
D_{{\bf v}}F({\bf a}) = \lim\limits_{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{ F({\bf a} + h{\bf v}) - F({\bf a})}{h}
$$
This is often denoted as as $\nabla{{\bf v}}$. 
### Partial derivatives
When ${\bf v} = {\bf e}_i$, this directional derivative is denoted by 
$$
D_{{\bf e}_i}F({\bf a}) = D_i F({\bf a}) = \frac{\partial F}{\partial x_i}({\bf a}) = F_{x_i}(\bf a)
$$
This is called the $i$-th partial derivative of $F$ at ${\bf a}$ (this is the partial derivative).

More explicitly, they are calculated via
$$
\nabla_{{\bf v}} F({\bf w}) = v_1 \frac{\partial F}{\partial w_1} + \cdots + v_n \frac{\partial F}{\partial w_n}
$$
${\bf v}, {\bf w} \in \mathbb{R}^n$

### [Example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXqhWeUEtQU&ab_channel=KhanAcademy)
Evaluate the partial derivatives of
$$
x^2 + xy - y^3
$$
In respect to $x$
$$
\frac{\partial}{\partial x} (x^2 + xy - y^3) = 2x + y
$$
In respect to $y$
$$
\frac{\partial}{\partial y} (x^2 + xy - y^3) = x - 3y^2
$$

## Theorem 8.1
Let $U$ be an open subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$. Given a function $F : U → \mathbb{R}^m$, a vector ${\bf 0} \neq {\bf v} ∈ \mathbb{R}^n$, a point ${\bf a} ∈ U$ , and ${\bf 0} \neq {\ bf c} ∈ R$, we have 
$$
D_{c{\bf v}}F ({\bf a}) = cD_{\bf v}F ({\bf a})
$$
