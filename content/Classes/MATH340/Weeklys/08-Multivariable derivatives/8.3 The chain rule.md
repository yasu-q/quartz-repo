## Theorem 8.7 The chain rule
Suppose $U$ and $V$ are open subsets of $\mathbb{R}^n$ and $\mathbb{R}^m$, respectively. Suppose $F : U → \mathbb{R}^m$ and $G : V → \mathbb{R}^k$ are differentiable at points ${\bf a} ∈ U$, and $F ({\bf a}) ∈ V$ , respectively. Assume $F (U) ⊆ V$ . Then, the composition $H = G ◦ F$ is differentiable at ${\bf a}$ and
$$
dH_{\bf a} = dG_{F ({\bf a})} ◦ dF_{\bf a}
$$
Furthermore, 
$$
H'({\bf a}) = G'(F ({\bf a}))F'({\bf a})
$$
Like the normal chain rule
## 8.12 Segments
Given two points ${\bf a}, {\bf b} ∈ \mathbb{R}^n$, the segment $L$ from ${\bf a}$ to ${\bf b}$ is the set given ${\bf b}$
$$
L = \{\, {\bf c} \in \mathbb{R}^n \, | \, {\bf c} = t{\bf b} + (1 - t){\bf a}, \text{ where } 0 \leq t \leq 1 \, \}
$$
## 8.13 A connect subset
A subset $E$ of $\mathbb{R}^n$ is called connected if for every ${\bf a}, {\bf b} ∈ E$ there is a continuous function $φ : [0, 1] → E$ whose restriction to $(0, 1)$ is differentiable, such that $φ(0) = {\bf a}$, and $φ(1) = {\bf b}$
## Theorem 8.8 Intermediate Value Theorem
 Suppose $E$ is a connected subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$, and let $f : E → \mathbb{R}$ be a continuous function. Suppose ${\bf a}, {\bf b} ∈ E$ are two points and $r$ is a real number between $f ({\bf a})$ and $f ({\bf b})$. Then, there is ${\bf a}, {\bf c} ∈ E$ for which $f ({\bf c}) = r$
## 8.14 Constant functions
A function $F : U → \mathbb{R}^m$ is called constant if there is some ${\bf c} ∈ \mathbb{R}^m$ for which $F ({\bf x}) = {\bf c}$ for all ${\bf x} ∈ U$
## Theorem 8.9
 Let $U$ be an open and connected subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$. A differentiable function $F : U → \mathbb{R}^m$ is constant if and only if $F'({\bf x}) = 0$ for all ${\bf x} ∈ U$

makes sense
## Theorem 8.10 Mean value theorem
Suppose $U$ is an open subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$, and ${\bf a}, {\bf b}$ are two points in $U$ such that $U$ contains the line segment $L$ from ${\bf a}$ to ${\bf b}$. If $f : U → \mathbb{R}$ is differentiable, then there is a point ${\bf c} ∈ L$ for which
$$
f({\bf b}) - f({\bf a}) = f'({\bf c}) ({\bf b} - {\bf a}) = \nabla f({\bf c}) \cdot ({\bf b} - {\bf a})
$$
## Theorem 8.11 Clairaut's / Mixed-Partial theorem
 Suppose $U$ is an open subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$. Suppose $f : U → \mathbb{R}$ has continuous first and second partial derivatives. Then for every $i, j$ we have 
$$
D_j D_i f({\bf a}) = D_iD_j f ({\bf a})
$$for all ${\bf a} ∈ U$
