## Theorem 3.3 
Let $A$ be a matrix

- The **dimension of Row($A$)** is ==**equal to the number of pivot entries of the echelon form**== of $A$. Furthermore, the nonzero rows of the echelon form of A form a basis for Row($A$). 
- The dimension of Col($A$) is equal to the number of pivot entries of the echelon form of $A$. Furthermore, the pivot columns of $A$ form a basis for Col($A$)

i.e. **dim**(Row($A$)) = **dim**(Col($A$))
***
## Example 3.3
Find the basis for Row($A$) and Col($A$) where 
$$ 
A =
\begin{pmatrix}
0 & 1 & 3 & 0 \\
-1 & -1 & 3 & -1 \\
1 & 2 & 0 & 1 \\
1 & 1 & 1 & 0
\end{pmatrix}
$$
**Note that to find a basis for Col($A$) we must look at pivot columns of $A$, and not those of its echelon form, but to find Row($A$) we need to look at the rows of $A$'s echelon form with pivot entries, not those of $A$ itself.**

bottom line we need to get to an echelon form of $A$ no matter what, so get cranking. Making the appropriate operations (*operations left as practice*) we arrive at:
$$
\begin{pmatrix}
-1 & -1 & 3 & -1 \\
0 & 1 & 3 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 4 & -1 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0
\end{pmatrix}
$$
Now, to find Row($A$) we can take the span of the rows of this reduced matrix.
$$
\text{Row}(A) = \text{span}\{[-1,-1,3,-1], \space [0,1,3,0], \space [0,0,4,-1]\}
$$Now, to find Col($B$) we need to look at the pivot columns index from the reduced form *in the original matrix*, these would be columns 1, 2, and 3. This lets use arrive at the conclusion that Col($A$) is
$$
\text{Col}(A)=\text{span}\{\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ -1 \\ 1 \\ 1\end{bmatrix}, \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ -1 \\ 2 \\ 1\end{bmatrix}, \begin{bmatrix} 3 \\ 3 \\ 0 \\ 1\end{bmatrix}\}
$$
By the way, all these are valid basis because these are linearly independent and generating for their respective spaces. It's kind of a given if you can turn a matrix into echelon form. ish? idfk

## 3.2 Rank
The rank of a matrix $A$ (denoted as rank $A$) is the dimension of Row($A$) or Col($A$). Note that both Row($A$) and Col($A$) have the same dimensions (basis size). This is also the same as the number of pivot entries
## 3.3 Transpose
The transpose of an $m \times n$ matrix $A$ is an $n \times m$ matrix denoted by $A^T$ whose every $(i,j)$ entry is the $(j,i)$ entry of $A$.

Note that this is not the inverse of a matrix.
## Theorem 3.4
For every matrix $A$, rank $A$ = rank $A^T$ 
### Null space (kernel)
The subspace created by vectors corresponding to valid solutions to homogeneous linear systems of equations
