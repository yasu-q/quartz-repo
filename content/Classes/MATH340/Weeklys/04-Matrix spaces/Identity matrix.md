- The $i$th column is given by ${\bf e}_i$ for ${\bf e}_i \in \mathbb{R}^n$. 
- Is always square
- Usually denoted as $I_n$
### Identity
If we have a $m \times n$ matrix $A$ and do $I_nA$ when the result will be $A$ again
$$
I_nA = A
$$
If $A$ is square $n \times n$, then they are [commuting](4.2%20Linear%20transformations%20and%20matrix%20operations.md) i.e.
$$
I_nA = AI_n =A
