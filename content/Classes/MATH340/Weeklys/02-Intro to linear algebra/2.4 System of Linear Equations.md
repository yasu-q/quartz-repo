Suppose we would like to solve the following system of equations
$$
\begin{matrix}
3x + 2y - z = 4 \\
x + 3y -2z = 1 \\
5x + y - z =4
\end{matrix}
$$
In order to solve this system, we will utilize elimination. In order to solve this in such a fashion, we will utilize an augmented matrix which looks something like the following for the system we are solving 
$$
\left( 
    \begin{array}{ccc|c}
        3 & 2 & -1 & 4 \\
        1 & 3 & -2 & 1 \\
        5 & 1 & -1 & 4
    \end{array}
\right)
$$
In the elimination method, we will add an appropriate multiple of one of the equations to another equation. This means we are doing the same thing to the rows of the augmented matrix. We note that each step is reversible and thus we are not inserting or eliminating any solutions. In this process, three operations are used. These are called elementary row operations

- **Row Addition**: Adding a scalar multiple of a row to another row
- **Row Interchange**: Changing the order of the rows
- **Row Scale**: Multiplying a row by a non-zero number

The objective is to obtain a matrix that satisfies the following conditions:

- All zero rows are at the bottom (if there are any)
- The entries below the first nonzero entry of each row are all zero (every number below the first non-zero in a row is zero)
- The leading nonzero entry of each row is to the left of the leading nonzero entry of all rows below it (i.e. they should form a staircase-like configuration)

A matrix in this configuration is said to be in **row echelon form**. It will look something like
$$
\left( 
    \begin{array}{}
        1 & 2 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
        0 & 0 & 2 & 5 & 4 \\
        0 & 0 & 0 & 4 & 8 \\
        0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0
    \end{array}
\right)
$$
If in addition to the above, the following are also satisfied:
- The first nonzero entry of each row is 1
- These ones are the only nonzero entry of their column
Then the matrix will be in **reduced row echelon form**

Algorithm to reach reduced echelon form 

- Interchange rows so that the first entry of the first row is nonzero. (If the first column is all zero, apply this to the first nonzero column.) 
- Using the first row and the row addition operation, make all entries below the first nonzero entry zero. 
- If possible, by interchanging rows, make the second entry of the second row nonzero. If not, move on to the next entry.
- Repeat this process so that you obtain a matrix in echelon form.  
- Scale all rows to obtain 1â€™s as the leading nonzero entries.
- Turn the rest of the entries in columns of each leading 1 into zero to obtain a matrix in reduced echelon form.
## Theorem 2.4
Every matrix can be turned into a matrix in reduced echelon form by applying the three elementary row operations. Furthermore, the reduced echelon form for any matrix is unique
### 2.7 Pivots
The leading nonzero entries in a matrix in echelon form are called pivot entries. Each column that contains a pivot entry is called a pivot column.
## 2.8 Homogenous systems
A system of linear equations is called homogenous if the right hand side of the system is all zeroes. In other words, any homogenous system is of the following form:
$$
\begin{matrix}
a_{11}x_1 + a_{12}x_2+...+a_{1n}x_n = 0 \\
a_{21}x_1 + a_{22}x_2+...+a_{2n}x_n = 0 \\
... \\
a_{m1}x_1+a_{m2}x_2+...+a_{mn}x_{n} = 0
\end{matrix}
$$Here, all $a_i$ are constants. Note that every homogeneous system has a trivial solution where all the variable terms are equal to zero.

Intuitively, in a homogeneous system if the number of equations is less than the number of variables, we must have infinitely many solutions.
## Theorem 2.5 
Any homogenous system that has less equations than variables has a nontrivial solution
### Corollary
Every $n+1$ vectors in $\mathbb{R}^n$ are linearly dependent
