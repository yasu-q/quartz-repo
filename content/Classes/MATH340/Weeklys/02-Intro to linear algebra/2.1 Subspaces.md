## 2.1 Subspaces
A subspace $W$ of $\mathbb{R}^n$ is a subspace of $\mathbb{R}^n$ if $W$ along with the same operations of $\mathbb{R}^n$ satisfy all properties of a vector space. (see [[1.4 Vector spaces]]) 
## Theorem 2.1 Criteria for a subspace
A subset $W$ of $\mathbb{R}^n$ is a subspace if and only if it satisfies all of the following:
- $W$ contains the zero vector
- for all $\vec{x},\vec{y} \in W \text{ and } c \in \mathbb{R}$, we have $\vec{x} + \vec{y} \in W \text{ and } c\vec{x} \in W$. (We say $W$ is closed under vector addition and scalar multiplication)
### Example subspaces:
- The set of all points $(x,y)$ on a given line $y=mx$ is a subspace of $\mathbb{R}^2$
- The $\{\vec{0}\} \text{ and } \mathbb{R}^n$ are subspaces of $\mathbb{R}^n$

Note that a subspace is a very specific subset on $\mathbb{R}^n$ such that it fulfills the mentioned rules. For example, a circle on $\mathbb{R}^2$ does not qualify as a valid subspace of $\mathbb{R}^2$

### Example 2.2
Show that if $W$ and $U$ are subspaces on $\mathbb{R}^n$, then so is $W \cap U$

We will use the subspace criterion (theorem 2.1). Note that $\vec{0}$ belongs to both $W \text{ and } U$ and thus must be within $W \cap U$

Suppose $\vec{x},\vec{y} \in U \cap W$ and $c \in \mathbb{R}$. By the definition of an intersection, $\vec{x}$ and $\vec{y}$ are both in $U$ and $W$. Since $U$ and $W$ are both subspace, by theorem 2.1 we have the following: $\vec{x} + \vec{y} \in W, \vec{x} + \vec{y} \in U, c\vec{x} \in W, c\vec{y} \in U$. Thus, by the definition of an intersection, $\vec{x} + \vec{y} \in U \cap W$, and $c\vec{x} \in U \cap W$. Which by the definition of a subspace, demonstrates how $W \cap U$ is a valid subspace on $\mathbb{R}^n$.
