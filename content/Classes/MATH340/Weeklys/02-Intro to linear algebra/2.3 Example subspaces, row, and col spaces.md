## Example 2.5 
Let $\mathcal{A}$ be a set of vectors in $\mathbb{R}^n$, and let "span $\mathcal{A}$" be the set consisting of all vectors that are linear combinations of some vectors of $\mathcal{A}$. Then span $\mathcal{A}$ is a subspace of $\mathbb{R}^n$. 

i.e. show that $\{span \text{ } \mathcal{A}\}$ is a subspace of $\mathcal{A}$.

Using the subspace criterion:
- show $\vec{0} \in \{span \text{ } \mathcal{A}\}$ 
- Show that $\{span \text{ } \mathcal{A}\}$ is closed.

1 Zero Vector:
The $\vec{0}$ as a linear combination of $c_1 \vec{v}_1 + c_2 \vec{v}_2 + ... + c_m\vec{v}_m$ can just be $\forall i, c=0$ which is the $\vec{0}$ added over and over again and via the additive identity the result of their sum is $\vec{0}$
2 Closure:
Let $(\vec{x}_1,\vec{y}_1)\in \{span \text{ } \mathcal{A}\}$, then by definition of a span ([[2.2 Linear dependency, spanning, and basis]]), $(\vec{x}_1,\vec{y}_1)$ can be rewritten as:
$$
\vec{x}=\sum c_i\vec{a_i} \space\space\text{ and } \space\space \vec{y}=\sum p_kb_k
$$
Where all vectors in the sums are contained within $\mathcal{A}$ by the definition of a span. This means that we can add there two vectors $\vec{x}$ and $\vec{y}$ to obtain a $\vec{z}$ the fashion
$$
\vec{x} + \vec{y} = \sum c_i\vec{a_i} +\sum p_k\vec{b}_k = \vec{z}
$$
Which of course, is another linear combination of the vectors within $\mathcal{A}$. Thus  $\{span \text{ } \mathcal{A}\}$ satisfies closured under addition.

In a similar fashion, we can simply take a $c \in \mathbb{R}$ and multiply it with, lets say $\vec{x}$, to obtain
$$
c \vec{x} = \sum cc_i\vec{i}
$$
Which once again, is a valid linear combination of vectors within $\mathcal{A}$.

As $\{span \text{ } \mathcal{A}\}$ contains the zero vector and satisfies closure under vector addition and multiplication (and is a subset of vectors of $\mathcal{A}$), it is a valid subspace of $\mathcal{A}$.
## 2.6 Matrix
Let $A$ be a $m\times n$ matrix (rows x cols). The row space of $A$ (denoted as $\text{Row}(A)$) is a subspace of $\mathbb{R}^n$ spanned by the rows of $A$. The column space of $A$ (denoted as $\text{Col}(A)$) is the subspace of $\mathbb{R}^n$ by the columns of $A$  
### Example 2.6
Consider the matrix $A$
$$
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 2 & -1 \\
0 & 4 & 2
\end{pmatrix}
$$
Describe the column and row spaces.
$$
\text{Col}(A) = \text{span}\{(1,2),(2,4),(-1,2)\} \space\space \text{ and } \space\space \text{Row}(A) = \text{span}(\{(1,2,-1),(0,4,2)\})
$$
## 2.7 Row and column spaces as vector spaces
Prove that the row space and column space of every matrix are valid subspaces (see def. in [[2.1 Subspaces]])

Essentially we know that the span of a set of vectors $\in \mathbb{R}^n$ is a valid subspace of $\mathbb{R}^n$. Since $\text{Col}(A)$ and $\text{Row}(A)$ both describe the spans of those respective vectors, and considering how each vector is $\in \mathbb{R}^n$, then these row and column spaces must also be valid subspaces of $\mathbb{R}^n$.
