## 9.4 Max and mins on a restriction
Suppose $S$ is a subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$, and $f : U \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is a function defined over an open subset $U$ of $\mathbb{R}^n$ containing $S$. We say the restriction of $f$ to $S$ attains a local minimum (resp. local maximum) at a point ${\bf a} \in S$ if there is an open ball $B_r({\bf a})$ for which $f({\bf x}) \geq f({\bf a})$ (resp $f({\bf x}) \leq f({\bf a})$) for every ${\bf x} \in B_r({\bf a}) \cap S$. If the restrictions of $f$ to $S$ attains a local minimum or a local maximum at ${\bf a}$, we say $f$ attains a local extremum at ${\bf a}$
## Theorem 9.3
Let $S$ be a subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$. Assume $f$ is a differentiable real-valued function defined one some open set containing $S$, and the restriction of $f$ to $S$ attains a local extremum at ${\bf a}$, then the gradient vector $\nabla f({\bf a})$ is orthogonal to all tangent lines to all curves on $S$ that pass through ${\bf a}$. tsumari, if $\varphi: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow S$ is a differentiable curve with $\varphi(t_0) = {\bf a}$, then $\nabla f({\bf a})$ is orthogonal to $\varphi '({\bf t_0})$
## 9.5 Manifolds
A $k$-dimensional manifold (or $k$-manifold) $M$ is a subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$ for which for evert point ${\bf a} \in M$ there is an open subset of $U$ of $\mathbb{R}^n$ containing ${\bf a}$ for which $U \cap M$ 'looks like' the $k$-dimensional space $\mathbb{R}^k$ 

note this is not a rigorous definition
## Theorem 9.4
If $M$ is a $k$-dimensional manifold in $\mathbb{R}^n$ and ${\bf a} \in M$, then $M$ has a $k$-dimensional tangent plane at ${\bf a}$. tsumari, all lines tangent to curves on $M$ at ${\bf a}$ that pass through ${\bf a}$ form a translation of a $k$-dimensional subspace of $\mathbb{R}^n$ 
## Theorem 9.5 
Suppose $g : \mathbb{R}^n → \mathbb{R}$ is continuously differentiable. If $M$ is the set of all points ${\bf x}$ with both $g({\bf x}) = 0$ and $\nabla g({\bf x}) \neq 0$, then $M$ is an $(n − 1)$-manifold. Given $a ∈ M$ , the gradient vector $\nabla g({\bf a})$ is orthogonal to the tangent plane to $M$ at ${\bf a}$
## Theorem 9.6 Lagrange multipliers (Simplified)
Suppose $g : \mathbb{R}^n → \mathbb{R}$ is continuously differentiable, and let $M$ be the set of all points $x ∈ \mathbb{R}^n$ that both $g({\bf x}) = 0$, and $g({\bf x}) \neq 0$. Suppose $f : \mathbb{R}^n → \mathbb{R}$ is differentiable. Assume the restriction of $f$ to $M$ attains a local extremum at a point $a ∈ M$ . Then $\nabla f ({\bf a}) = λ\nabla g({\bf a})$ for some scalar $λ$.
## Theorem 9.7 Lagrange multipliers
Suppose $G = (G_1, . . . , G_m) : \mathbb{R}^n → \mathbb{R}^m$ is continuously differentiable, and denote by $M$ the set of all points $x ∈ \mathbb{R}^n$ such that $G({\bf x}) = {\bf 0}$, and also the gradient vectors $∇G_1({\bf a}), . . . , ∇G_m({\bf a})$ are linearly independent. Let $f : \mathbb{R}^n → \mathbb{R}$ be differentiable. Assume the restriction of $f$ to $M$ attains a local extremum at some point $a ∈ M$ . Then $∇f ({\bf a})$ is a linear combination of $∇G_1({\bf a}), . . . , ∇G_m({\bf a})$

two constraints
${\bf a}$ is on the constraint i think
