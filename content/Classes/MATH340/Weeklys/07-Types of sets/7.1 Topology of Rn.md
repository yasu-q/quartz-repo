## 7.1 Open sets
A subset $A$ or $\mathbb{R}^n$ is called open if given any point ${\bf a} \in A$, there exists an open ball $B_r({\bf a})$ that is entirely within $A$. see balls in [[6.1 Limits]]
## Theorem 7.1
The open sets in $\mathbb{R}^n$ satisfy the following properties:

1. $\emptyset$ and $\mathbb{R}^n$ are open

2. The union of any collection of open sets is open

3. The intersection of any finite number of sets is open
## 7.2 Closed sets
A subset $A$ of $\mathbb{R}^n$ is closed iff $\mathbb{R}^n - A$ is open. i.e. if its complement is open
## Theorem 7.2
A subset $A$ of $\mathbb{R}^n$ is closed if an only if it contains all of its limit points. 

see limit points in [[6.1 Limits]]
## Theorem 7.3 
Closed subsets of $\mathbb{R}^n$ satisfy the following properties

1.  $\emptyset$ and $\mathbb{R}^n$ are closed

2. The union of any finite number of closed sets is closed

3. The intersection of any collection of closed sets is closed
