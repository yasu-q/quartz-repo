## Theorem 7.4
Let $f : \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^m$ be a function

1. $f$ is continuous iff for any given open subset of $U$ of $\mathbb{R}^m$, the inverse image $f^{-1}(U)$ is an open subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$

2. $f$ is continuous iff if given any closed subset $C$ of $\mathbb{R}^m$ the inverse image $f^{-1}(C)$ is a closed subset $\mathbb{R}^n$

'if a subset in of codomain is open, then its pre-image will also be open'
'if a subset of the codomain is closed, then the pre-image of that subset will be closed'
