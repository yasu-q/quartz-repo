Recall the definition of a derivative on for a function $f : \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ 
$$
f'(a) = \lim\limits_{h \rightarrow 0}\frac{f(a+h) - f(a)}{h}
$$
This can also be written as
$$
\lim\limits_{h \rightarrow 0}\frac{f(a+h) - f(a) - f'(a)h}{h} = 0
$$
tsumari, the value of $f(a + h) - f(a)$ is very close to $f'(a)h$, when $h$ is small. That that $f'(a)h$ is a linear function in terms of $h$. 
## 7.5 Derivatives 
Given a function $f : I \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$, where $I \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is an open interval, the derivative of $f$ at point $a \in \mathbb{I}$ is given by
$$
f'(a) = \lim\limits_{h \rightarrow 0}\frac{f(a+h) - f(a)}{h}
$$
If this limit does not exist, we say $f$ is not differentiable at $a$. The $n$-th derivative of $f$ at $a$, denoted as $f^n(a)$, is recursively defined as the derivative $f^{n-1}$ at $a$. Note that for the $n$th derivative of $f$ to exist at $a$, the $(n-1)$ derivative of $f$ must exist on an open interval centered at $a$,
## Theorem 7.7 
Suppose $f = (f_1, \cdots, f_n) : I \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$ is a continuous function, where $I \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ is an open interval. Then, $f$ is differentiable at a point $a \in I$ iff $f_j$ is differentiable for all $j, j = 1, \dots, n$ . Furthermore, if $f$ is differentiable at $a$, them $f'(a) = (f_1'(a), \dots, f_n'(a))$. Proof from Theorem 6.2 in [[6.1 Limits]]
## Theorem 7.8 Properties of derivatives
Let $a$ be a real number and $I$ be an open interval. Suppose $f,g : I \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$, and $\phi : I \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ are differentiable at $a$. Then,

1. $(f + g)'(a) = f'(a) + g'(a)$

2. $(f \cdot g)'(a) = f(a)\cdot g'(a) + f'(a) \cdot g(a)$ yes this is the dot product

3. $(\phi f)'(a) = \phi'(a) f(a) + \phi(a) f'(a)$
## Theorem 7.9 Chain rule
Suppose $I$ and $J$ are open intervals, $\phi : I \rightarrow J$ is differentiable at $a \in I$, and $f : J \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$ is differentiable at $\phi(a)$, then
$$
(f \circ \phi)'(a) = \phi'(a)f'(\phi(a))
$$
Normal chain rule
## 7.6 Differentials
Let $I$ be an open interval, and $f : I \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$ is a function that is differentiable at a point $a \in I$. The linear function $L : \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$ defined by $L(h) = f'(a)h$ denoted by $df_a$ is called the differential of $f$ at $a$. 

Its $df = f(x)dx$ 
## Theorem 7.10
The function $f : I \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$ is differentiable at some $a \in I$, where $I$ is an open interval, iff there exists a linear transformation $L : \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$ such that
$$
f'(a) = \lim\limits_{h \rightarrow 0}\frac{f(a+h) - f(a) - L(h)}{h} = 0
$$
Furthermore, when such a linear transformation exists, it is unique and $$L(h) = f'(a)h$$
See linear transformations in [[4.2 Linear transformations and matrix operations]]
### Composition of differentials
Note that 
$$
d(f \circ \phi)_a = df_{\phi(a)} \circ d \phi_a
$$
## 7.7 Continuous differentiability
let $I \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ be an interval. A curve $f : I \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$ is called $k$ times differentiable or $C^k$ if it satisfies all of the following

1. $f$ has $k$ derivatives at all points inside $I$ except at its endpoints, if any,

2. $f^k$ is continuous

3. $f$ is continuous on $I$ 
### Other vocabulary
- We say $f$ is smooth or $C^\infty$ if is is $C^k$ for every $k \in \mathbb{Z}^+$. 
- We say $f$ is piecewise smooth if $I$ can be partitioned into finitely many intervals $I_1, I_2, \dots, I_m$ where the restriction of $f$ to each $I_j$ is a smooth curve. 
- A curve $f : [a ,b] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$ is called closed if $f(a) = f(b)$. A curve 
- A curve $f : I \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$ is called simple if it is one-to-one except possible at its endpoints. In other words, if $f(s) = f(t)$ for some $s, t \in I$ then $s = t$ or both are endpoints. See [[1.2 Functions]]. i.e. they are injective except, possibly, at the endpoints
## Theorem 7.11
Suppose $f : [a, b] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$ is a simple $C^1$ curve. The arc length of this curve is given by
$$
\int_{a}^{b} ||\, f'(t) \,|| dt 
$$
***
## Example 7.10
Find the length of the curve $f : \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^3$ given by $f(t) = (e^t, e^{-t}, \sqrt{2}t)$ 

See that $f'(t) = (e^t, -e^{-t}, \sqrt{2})$ 
$$
\int_{a}^{b} ||\, f'(t) \,|| \, dt  \Rightarrow \int_{a}^{b} \sqrt{e^{2t}+e^{-2t} + 2} \, dt
$$
[cosh(x)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_functions) = $\frac{e^x + e^{-x}}{2}$ 
$$
\int_{a}^{b} \sqrt{2\cosh(2t) + 2} \, dt \Rightarrow \int_{a}^{b} \sqrt{2(\cosh(2t) + 1)} \, dt
$$
via $2\cosh^2(x) = \cosh(x) + 1$ 
$$
\int_{a}^{b} \sqrt{2(2\cosh^2(t)} \, dt \Rightarrow \int_{a}^{b} \sqrt{4\cosh^2(t)} \, dt
$$
Which simplifies to 
$$
\int_{a}^{b} 2\cosh(t)\, dt \Rightarrow 2 \,[\sinh(b) - \sinh(a)] 
$$
