### Disparity between crack cocaine and powder cocaine charges

## Incarceration
- Drug policies MASSIVELY drove up the rate of incarceration for drug-related charges
- African-Americans disproportionally represented in drug-related incarcerations
- African-American communities more susceptible to surveillance by police
## Connection to poverty
- "This means that the social disadvantages associated with convictions and imprisonment will be visited particularly on impoverished minority populations. Long prison terms, as has been well documented, tend to exacerbate social inequalities, to create dysfunctional personal relationships, and to produce more imprisonment"
- Poverty-prison cycle
## Alienation of rights
- States take away the the rate of voting to felons
### Social aspect of racism
- "most Americans have grown beyond the evils of overt racial malice, but still have not completely shed the deeply rooted cultural bias that differentiates between ‘them’ and ‘us.’”"
- The law of inherently tied to societal values, and thus will reflect racist ones if society is inherently racist
