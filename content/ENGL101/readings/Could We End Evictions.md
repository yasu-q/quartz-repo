[Could We End Evictions?](https://hammerandhope.org/article/kc-tenants-end-evictions)
***
"we clarified that our goal wasnâ€™t to win an eviction moratorium; our goal was to end evictions."

Chronologically presented
	- More personal feel
	- It feels like 'something someone went through'
	- Mentions specific personal examples
- Very grounded with the 'common people'
	- Omit talking too broadly about policy
		- Aimed at the common people
- Like someone is telling a story

Evictions ARE violence
- To justify their actions
- Evictions in the winter kills
- Very jarring, but gets their view on evictions across

"No justice for the people, no peace for the oppressors"
- Very direct language
- Slumlords

People join the organization
- Directly benefit as a result ('join our cause!')

Bipartisan take on the issue
- don't care about the politics
- appeal to a wider audience
