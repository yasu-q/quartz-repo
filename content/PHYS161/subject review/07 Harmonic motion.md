# Simple Harmonic Motion

Simple Harmonic Motion (SHM) is a type of periodic motion where the restoring force is directly proportional to the displacement from the equilibrium position and is directed towards it.

- The motion is periodic and repetitive.
- The acceleration is directly proportional to the displacement and is always directed towards the equilibrium position.
- The velocity is maximum at the equilibrium position and minimum at the extreme positions.
- The displacement, velocity, and acceleration are all sinusoidal functions of time.
- The period of oscillation is independent of the amplitude.

Examples of SHM include: A mass attached to a spring and oscillating vertically or a A pendulum swinging back and forth.


Displacement: $x = A \cos(ωt + φ)$

Velocity: $v = -Aω \sin(ωt + φ)$

Acceleration: $a = -Aω^2 \cos(ωt + φ)$


where A is the amplitude, ω is the angular frequency, t is the time, and φ is the phase angle.

## Energy in SHM

The total mechanical energy of a system undergoing SHM is constant and is the sum of kinetic and potential energy.

- Total energy: $E = \frac{1}{2} kA^2$
- Kinetic energy: $K = \frac{1}{2} mv^2$
- Potential energy: $U = \frac{1}{2} kx^2$

where k is the spring constant, m is the mass, v is the velocity, and x is the displacement.

# Force and Amplitude

## Force in Simple Harmonic Motion

Since the block is acceleration and deceleration, there must be some force that is making it do so. This this cause, the spring exerts a force on the block.

- It is a vector quantity, meaning it has both magnitude and direction.
- The SI unit of force is Newton (N).
- Force can cause an object to accelerate, change direction, or deform.

$$F = -kx$$

Also known as Hooke’s Law, the k is the called the spring constant and tells us how strong the spring is. The greater the K, the stiffer the spring actually is.

## Amplitude

- Amplitude is a measure of the magnitude of a wave.
- It is the maximum displacement of a particle from its equilibrium position in a wave.
- Amplitude is measured in meters (m) for a mechanical wave and in volts (V) for an electromagnetic wave.
- The amplitude of a wave determines its intensity and energy.
- The amplitude of a wave can also affedct th eforc e.

# Period and Frequency

## Period

- The period of a wave is the time it takes for one complete cycle of the wave to occur.
- It is denoted by the symbol T and is measured in seconds (s).
- The period is inversely proportional to the frequency of the wave.
- Mathematically, T = 1/f, where f is the frequency of the wave.

## Frequency

- The frequency of a wave is the number of complete cycles of the wave that occur in one second.
- It is denoted by the symbol f and is measured in Hertz (Hz).
- The frequency is directly proportional to the energy of the wave.
- Mathematically, f = 1/T, where T is the period of the wave.

# Pendulums

In a system, if the spring is used the period will increase with objects mass and decrease with as a greater spring constant increases. This is because a mass will resist acceleration and a large spring constant will make the spring exert more force.

- Object's mass affects the period of the spring, not the pendulum
- Mass can act as either inertial or gravitational
- Gravitational mass accelerates due to the force of gravity between it and the Earth
- All objects fall at the same rate due to gravitational mass
- Inertial mass is not pushed by gravity but by external forces like the spring force
- Inertial mass can accelerate at different rates depending on the force applied

Pendulums are a common topic in AP Physics Unit 7, which covers simple harmonic motion. A pendulum is a weight suspended from a pivot point that swings back and forth due to gravity. The period of a pendulum (the time it takes to complete one full swing) is determined by the length of the pendulum and the acceleration due to gravity. The equation for the period of a pendulum is T=2π√(L/g), where T is the period, L is the length of the pendulum, and g is the acceleration due to gravity. Pendulums are used in many applications, such as clocks and seismometers.

T = period, L = length, g = gravity (~~pi=3~~)

$$ \large{T=2 \pi \sqrt{\frac{L}{g}}} \,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\  \large{f=\frac{1}{2\pi}\sqrt{\frac{g}{L}}}  $$
